in silico identification and deconvolution of scRNA doublets
<title>
background
</title>
<body>
1) Doublets occur when two cells are encased in the microfluidics of a scRNA device
2) A crude method of identifying doublets is by number of transcripts 
3) Doublets have weird transcriptomes and are typically discarded from analysis


So
1) Are there more intelligent ways to identify doublets
	model based on similarity scores to things like scmca maybe
2) Can we distinguish in situ doublets from accidental doublets
	based on cellphone interactivity score maybe
3) Can we use in-situ doublets to artifically reconstruct a spatial map
	Probably some awful hidden markoff model based on 2

research plan
